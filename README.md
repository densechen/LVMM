# LVMM
Implementation of `Animating General Image with Large Visual Motion Model`

We plan to make the code related to our experiment openly available in the near future. However, the training procedure for the LVMM model incorporates some of our company's internal data. We're currently in discussions with our legal team to address potential conflicts of interest. It's possible that we may only release some pre-trained models that were developed using public datasets.
